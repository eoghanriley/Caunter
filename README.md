## Im a streamer how do I configure Caunter?

It depends on how much you want to configure. The first step is to create a browser source in obs and have it capture Caunter.
You can configure how Caunter looks in settings. More customization features will be coming soon for heavy configuration.
You are able to make the background transparent with a chroma key in obs.
